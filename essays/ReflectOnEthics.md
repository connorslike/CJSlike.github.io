   The ethical dilemmas that programmers face vary due to the magnitude of problems a programmer may face. 
  Depending on what you are programming you may be forced to change what you think is ethical or not. 
  For example a programmer creating a missile guidance system would have to ethically balance if they believe what they are 
  doing is right versus having a job. While as securities programmer may have to balance how secure they would like to 
  make their users data versus the amount of money the company they are working for is willing to let them spend. 
  As you can see the spectrum in which ethics is involved in programming is vast. I believe that an ethical programmer 
  does the most “good” that they can with the wiggle room they are allotted. 

  To better explain this we will look at a case where a security programmer must balance user data 
  security and they budget they are allotted by the company. In this case I believe the programmer 
  should follow the guidelines that the company has given them with their budget, however they should utilize that 
  budget to its full potential in protecting the user's information rather than doing the bare minimum with it and 
  saving the rest of the budget. This is a common case that many in the Information Technology field are faced with. 
  Balancing a budget with ensuring the integrity of their system. Ethical programmers would ensure that they do the most 
  they can with what they have rather than doing the minimum and looking good to those above them.

  I believe that it may not be possible to be as ethical as possible. It may not be possible for programmers to go 
  above and beyond to ensure that all of the software that they make will not harm users, or that the system they design 
  can be the best possible as if they had unlimited resources. However it is possible for programmers to ensure that they 
  do everything in their ability using the resources to create the best quality product possible with the resources they have, 
  and if they succeed in that then they are practicing ethical programming.
