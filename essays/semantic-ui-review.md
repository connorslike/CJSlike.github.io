<p> If you have ever tried programming a web page you are most likely among those who know how difficult it is to add simple features without 
 ruining the format of your site. Just adding something as small as an input feature could turn your beautiful web page into a horrid 
 mess of misaligned divâ€™s. However there is a way to save time and frustration, and that is to use a UI Framework. </p>
  
<h2> Why Semantic?</h2>
  
<p> Now you may be wondering why you should waste your time using a UI Framework like Semantic when you already know CSS. 
 Why waste your time learning a framework that basically does everything you already can do. The answer is time. 
 Using a framework will allow you to do things with your website in minutes that would have normally taken you hours using pure CSS. 
 Take a look at the example below.</p>
<div class="ui ordered horizontal list">
  <button class="positive ui button">Positive Button</button>
  <input type="button" id="myBtn" onclick="myFunction()" value="Button">
</div>
