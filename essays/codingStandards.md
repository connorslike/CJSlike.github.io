I believe that coding standards are an important practice no matter what field in computer science that you are working in. This becomes doubly true when working in teams even if they are small groups. The unique thing about working with code, is that even if you do not follow any given format the computer will understand what you are trying to write and will run the code as long as it follows the given syntax. While this may work for machines it makes it near impossible for a human to understand what you are trying to run if it is written haphazardly. However, if it is following some given coding standard I think that it makes the code easier for yourself and others to understand what is being attempted and what needs to be done to make it work. 

Intellij seems like a very useful tool for programming. It is many steps ahead of jsfiddle which comes with next to no syntax checking. While I do enjoy using Intellij, ESLint is another matter entirely. I do believe that it is important to having some kind of coding standard however ESLint seems to be much harder to get working than it should be. The only thing that I would have changed is making ESLint much easier to install.

The coding standard assistance that ESLint does offer when it can work is very helpful. It essentially standardizes how everyone’s code should look, allowing a programmer and their peer’s the ability to look at code and clearly and concisely understand what the programmer is attempting to do. Overall while getting that green check is something that we should all strive for, I think that it is taking away from the main point of coding, and that is to make functioning code that reflects a client’s needs.
