I have found that javascript is a very powerful tool in this new world of web applications. It is amazing how many things you can do with javascript
that would have only been a dream if you were stuck only using html and css. I think that if you have not already taken a look at javascript it is definitely
something that any programmer would like to take a look at. The sheer amount of functionality that it has from creating variables to the limitations of those
variables are something that you don't really see in any other language. Coming from a person who has had zero javascript programming experience before this class
I can tell you first hand that this is like no other language you have used before. 

As far as athletic software engineering goes it is indeed a different way to look at programming. It does really make things a lot more stressful
however it does ingrain the basic coding concepts into your mind so you will definitely not forget them. While this type of coding does go against how I normally code, It has really helped my thing on my feet and has removed my reliance on the need to check a reference every couple of seconds. 

Overall I really do enjoy using the javascript language and all of the functionality that it has provided me. And I feel that athletic software engineering is a good way to introduce beginners into the world of programming and keeping them from being reliant on references.
