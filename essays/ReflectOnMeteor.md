There is, hands down, no better way to explain my experience with meteor. As my title shows, 
my first couple of days using the meteor architecture. Meteor has to be one of the most confusing 
architectures to begin using, with so many different files to download and run you may give up halfway through 
setup. However if you can fight your way through the initial setup you will find that Meteor is one of the funnest and 
most interesting architectures to use.
