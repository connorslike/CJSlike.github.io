There is, hands down, no better way to explain my experience with meteor. As my title shows, 
my first couple of days using the meteor architecture. Meteor has to be one of the most confusing 
architectures to begin using, with so many different files to download and run you may give up halfway through 
setup. However if you can fight your way through the initial setup you will find that Meteor is one of the funnest and 
most interesting architectures to use. 

## Getting Started

When you first start to setup Meteor you may notice something about Meteor. Loading takes time, a lot of time. In fact you may find yourself sitting around doing nothing for quite a long time when you first begin to set up Meteor. On the bright side it does get faster when you start building projects, but not by much.

Above is a screen you should get familiar with as you will spend a lot of time looking at it. With whispers of a patch with faster loading speeds in the air, it has yet come to the general public. 

So far you may be wondering why anyone would want to use Meteor when all you have read is how clunky and slow it is to run and use. Well now we get to the good part. I have never used a program that has been more convenient to program with. While I have only really scratched the surface of Meteor, while programming interactive web apps, Meteor is always ready to update your page in real time allowing you as the programmer to see what kinds of changes are happening in real time. This is one kind of functionality other programming architectures just do not offer, which is the convenience of not having to refresh your page over and over again with the auto publish feature.

So why use Meteor architecture? Once you get over the initial learning curve of Meteor you will find that it is hard to find another program that offers the instant response that Meteor does, even if it does take a little longer to load than other programs, with the correct configuration you will find that Meteor is a fun and interactive program that makes web development much easier and convenient.
