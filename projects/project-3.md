summary: Practive designing and implementing a website

<div class="ui small rounded images">

</div>

This is a website I began to design on my own free time to practice different functions and techniques when it came to programming in html and css. In this case I began to dabble in the use of javascript to make a simple yet effective scheduling application that would allow a useer to create a work schedule based off of a list of entries. 

This project greatly helped me in learning the practical applications of javascript and how you could use it in conjunction with other languages such as css and html to make a fully functioning web application. The majority of the site is made from scratch with html and css. Making the site from scratch really helped me learn the basics and helped me set a good foundation on html practices rather than using third party software to make it.
