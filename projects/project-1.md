This is a game I developed in my ICS 111 class, which was an introduction to basic programming. The main purpose for this program was to introduce the class to programming in java and learn basic command line structure.

The majority of this program is created through the use of functions from the EZ library. The EZ library was a library created by the TA for the class in order to create a simple way for students to create a simple GUI while introducing them to the java environment. 

Through this project we learned the value of resource managment and the effect of run time cammand line entries. This project helped the students get a better understanding of how resorces should be allocated when creating a game and how to properly use run time command line arguments to create a smooth and bug free program.

You can watch the game played on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy7d7j49Gvs).
